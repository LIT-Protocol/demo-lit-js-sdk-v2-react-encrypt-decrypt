# Lit Protocol New JS SDK Demo

This is a demo of the new Lit Protocol JS SDK. It is a simple web app that allows you to encrypt and decrypt data using the Lit Protocol. This new SDK is written in typescript and is a complete rewrite of the old SDK. It is much more modular and easier to use. It is also much more secure and has a much smaller bundle size.
